## About
Uses the Naive Bayes Classifier to predict the political party of the author of a Tweet. Uses data from [Quorum Analytics](https://quorum.us).

## Data Procurement
Quorum has over 1 million labeled Tweets in their database. We will use these Tweets to train our classifier. We will be writing a small API to easily interact with the Tweet data. That API is currently under construction.
