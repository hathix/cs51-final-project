The seminal work of Poole and Rosenthal (1985) introduced the
ideal point model
, using
roll call data to infer the latent political positions of the lawmakers.  The ideal point model
is  a  latent  factor  model  of  binary  data  and  an  application  of  item-response  theory  (Lord
1980)  to  roll  call  data.   It  gives  each  lawmaker  a  latent  political  position  along  a  single
dimension and then uses these points (called the ideal points) in a model of the votes.  (Two
lawmakers with the same position will have the same probability of voting in favor of each
bill.)  From roll call data, the ideal point model recovers the familiar division of Democrats
and Republicans.
