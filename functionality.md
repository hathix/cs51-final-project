###Progress:
    
* We obtained the database of tweets from Quorum. We also wrote the code to build a frequency list of words found in each tweet, as well as removes common words. extract (in utils.py) extracts the stemmed form of non-basic words. 

*The class Tweet is defined with party, name, text, and freq_list. 

*We started working on the Bayes classifier (as of Wednesday) and 


###Problems:

###Teamwork:

*We have split up the work pretty evenly. One problem we dealt with was working efficiently, which we dealt with by meeting together to get some work done. 

###Plan:
    
*We will be finishing the Bayes classifier and accuracy calculator. We will also set up a front end and set up the Tweet database. Neel will be doing the Bayes classifier, Sam will be working on the front end and routing, Ajay will be setting up the database, and Saranya will be writing the accuracy calculator.
